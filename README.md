Where I will take on various pandas challenges








# 1. Heroes of Pymoli

In this challenge I was given a dataset containing a number of purchase records from a game. I was tasked to create Data tables containing the following information:

* Player Count
* Purchase Analysis
* Gender Demographics
* Gender Purchasing Analysis
* Age Demographics
* Age Purchasing Analysis
* Top Spenders
* Most Popular Items
* Most Profitable Items

## Notable Insights

* The vast majority of purchases were done by males (84%)
* The age range follows a normal curve, peaking in the 20-24 range, and tapering downward on either side.
* While the majority of purchases were done by males, the average purchase was higher for females, and higher still for other/undefined.
